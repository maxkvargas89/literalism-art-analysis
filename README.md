# 🎬 Literalism in Art: A Data Analysis of Movies and Cultural Trends

This project explores the rise of **literalism in contemporary art and media**, with a focus on the evolution of content in **blockbuster movies**, the decline of **independent cinema**, and the cultural forces shaping both.

We pull and analyze data from multiple sources including:
- **TMDb / IMDb** for film metadata
- **Yelp** for art gallery trends and closures
- Additional sources for art criticism and media trends

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze how blockbuster content has changed over the past 60+ years
- Track the **decline of indie films** in terms of volume, visibility, and critical success
- Explore changes in the **number and type of art galleries** over time
- Uncover evidence of a broader shift toward **literalism** in mainstream creative output
